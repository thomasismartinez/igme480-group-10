        <h1>Backstory</h1>
        <p>Anyone who has ever attended a higher education institution has likely endured an unremarkable orientation session filled with boilerplate information, supposedly preparing them for the years of school ahead. However, in the fall of 2007 at RIT, there was a fateful presentation that left a lasting mark on the cultural subconscious of its students. This event sparked a butterfly effect of ironic social commentary, which, until recently, prominently occupied the very doorstep of the campus.

            It all began with a PSA video shown during the orientation presentation on the sensitive subject of sexual assault. The video had an overly contrived and "fellow kids" tone. As described in this Reddit post, characters in the video uttered lines like "Hey son, excited for school, son?" "Hey son, let's go to a party, son," and "Let's make moves, son." It is generally remembered as a cringeworthy and unintentionally satirical part of the orientation presentation. Ironically, this short video seems to be the only part of the orientation that alumni from that class remember.
            
            Later in the year, the words “Make moves, son” were spray-painted on a rundown and abandoned house directly across the street from the campus block on John St. This act of vandalism initiated a cycle of paint-overs and re-vandalizations, sometimes with the original slogan and sometimes with alternatives like “Wash hands, son” during the COVID epidemic. This battle persisted for 17 years until the house was ultimately demolished in the fall of 2024.
